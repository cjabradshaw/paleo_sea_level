In this folder, you should place your calculated sea level files. The files should be placed
into folders that are named after the ice sheet reconstruction you are using. The name of the
files should be "earth_model.dat", where "earth_model" is the name of the earth model
you are using.

The file "create_plots.sh" in the folder above creates the input files that are used to
access the files placed here. So it is important to have things in the format:

ice_sheet_model/earth_model.dat
