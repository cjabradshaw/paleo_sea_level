This folder contains spreadsheets and raw datasets that I use to sort things for before entering 
into the "regions" datasets. I have set this up for my own purposes to keep things organized and 
backed up, so most things here are likely not of use to anyone but me.

- Baltic.ods: Contains information from the Rosentau Baltic database. 
- Vink_North_Sea.ods: contains the compilation by Vink et al (2007), which was not appended to the online paper, for some reason.
